# aws-deepracer-in-24h
AWS Deepracer challenge, Toronto turnpike
https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/league/

We (https://github.com/EXYNOS-999 and I) found out about the challenge just over 24 hours before the submission deadline. We were able to submit a model in only 24 hours, from knowing absolutely nothing about Reinforcement Learning to training and evaluating 4 different models using 4 different reward functions. Our best model was ranked 835 out of almost 2000 submissions.
